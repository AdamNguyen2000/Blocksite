## Blocksite Project: Pull Request Overview
### Overview
This project enhances the Blocksite page by providing more detailed context for why certain sites are blocklisted. Includes actionable links for those to resolve issues, such as submitting tickets or contacting support.
### Design & Branding
- The page follows style guidelines, using blue (`#0073b1`) and maintaining consistency with fonts like Arial and Helvetica for simplicity and compatibility.
- Colors were chosen by inspecting elements.
### Base64 Images
- Instead of external image references, Base64-encoded images are used in the CSS for better compatibility across servers. This avoids broken image links and reduces HTTP requests, ensuring reliable display regardless of the environment.
### Content & Purpose
- The page provides clear reasons for blocklisting, such as security concerns, untrusted sites, and unsupported services.
### Development Process
1. **HTML & CSS:** The page structure and styling adhere to LinkedInâ€™s brand standards.
2. **Base64 Embedding:** Images were encoded in Base64 to ensure seamless deployment across servers.
3. **Content:** Explanatory text gives users clarity on blocked sites and offers go/ links for support.
